# WE-Module3

This repository contains various assignments and work done in the Women Engineers Program (module-3) related to GenAI and prompt engineering.
This repository contains various reports on learning how GenAI behaves and how easy and difficult it can make learning. I have implemented various codes shared by GenAI related to some problems and highlighted its errors and incomplete solutions in the reports and code implementation. 

Learning new things and asking GenAI questions about previously known topics made it very clear on how prompt engineering plays a crucial role in using GenAI efficiently.
